Task 3: Dashboard Development
Project Title: Pixar Films Dashboard â€“ Visualizing Movie Insights
Description of What I Did:
For Task 3 of the internship, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize the Pixar Films dataset using Microsoft Power BI. The purpose of this task was to turn raw data into clear, visual insights that anyone can understand. Charts, filters, and visuals helped show information like movie ratings, revenue, and release years.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Microsoft Power BI

Pixar Films dataset (CSV file)

Bar charts, line charts, slicers (for interactivity)

Steps I Followed:
Opened Power BI and imported the Pixar Films CSV file.

Explored the dataset to understand what fields were available (e.g., title, year, budget, revenue).

Created bar charts to show IMDB Scores by film and line charts for revenue trends over the years.

Added slicers (dropdown filters) to allow users to filter by release year or genre.

Customized the look of the dashboard (colors, titles, layout).

Saved the report as a Power BI file (.pbix).

Output:
An interactive dashboard showing:

IMDB scores by film

Budget vs revenue over the years

Filters to explore the data easily
